C++ Tetris Game

This is a game that I realized a few years ago in the high school when I learning OOP and C++.
The game is functional in the single player mode, but need a better dessing on asssets. My idea was to develop a multiplayer game mode, but that part is not made.

I'm not interested in continuing the development of this game, but if anyone is interested in doing so can contact me.
