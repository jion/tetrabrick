C++ Tetris Game

This is a game that I made for fun when I was a kid. I was trying to apply and understand different techniques related to OOP and game design.
The original plan was to create a multiplayer game where you can play Tetris up to 8 players in a network, but I never finished the multiplayer feature (Although I learned a lot about networking and socket programming trying to accomplish this).

The game is functional in Single Player mode, and I think is pretty fun actually. I'll add some screenshoots and instructions to compile soon.

I'm not interested in continuing the development of the game, but if anyone is interested in doing that, just fork it :) .
